You can find my website link [here](https://ipekoke.wixsite.com/210proj).
I did not add my findings in the README file, but they are on the website. I also could not upload my entire health file, as it is too long (and not appropriate to share on the internet?).

## My Motivation

Undertaking the project of building a website to visualize and analyze my sleep data holds several compelling motivations. Primarily, it serves as a powerful tool for enhancing personal health by offering insights into sleep patterns and encouraging positive changes in habits. The endeavor also presents an opportunity for skill development, involving the application of technologies such as Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript for interactive charting. Beyond personal growth, the project aligns with an interest in data analysis, allowing for the exploration of trends and patterns within sleep data. Aspiring to build a portfolio, the project showcases proficiency in both data science and web development, potentially appealing to future employers. Additionally, the integration of wearable device data provides an exciting exploration of technology interoperability. Sharing the website with friends and family fosters a sense of community and allows for collective engagement in monitoring sleep patterns. Finally, considering the possibility of open-sourcing the project adds a dimension of community contribution, amplifying its potential impact. Ultimately, the project's multifaceted motivations converge to create a meaningful and personally rewarding undertaking.



## My Sources

The sleep data utilized in this project originates from the Apple Health app. The collection process began with data recorded on the phone itself, subsequently incorporating data from a Mi Band, and later, an Apple Watch. Leveraging these wearables allowed for a comprehensive and continuous tracking of sleep patterns. The integration of multiple sources enhances the richness and accuracy of the sleep data presented on this website, providing a holistic view of the user's sleep habits over time.



## My Analysis

While my project on analyzing sleep patterns and creating visualizations provides valuable insights into personal habits and health, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations. Firstly, the accuracy of the analysis heavily relies on the precision of the data collected, and any discrepancies or incomplete information may affect the reliability of the findings. Additionally, this project operates within the constraints of self-reported data, potentially introducing biases or inaccuracies due to subjective interpretations or memory lapses. Furthermore, the scope of the analysis is limited to the parameters and variables included in the dataset, and factors such as external stressors, lifestyle changes, or medical conditions, which can significantly impact sleep patterns, may not be fully accounted for. Lastly, the project assumes a level of consistency in the recorded data, and variations in data collection methods or tools across different time periods may introduce uncertainties. Acknowledging these limitations is crucial for interpreting the results accurately and recognizing the boundaries of the insights gained from this analysis.

In the future research can be done again with more accurate and more data, possibly with machine learning models.
